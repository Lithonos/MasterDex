The Master Dex Project

This is the Master Dex Project - a comprehensive collection of all things Pokemon throughout the games. The Master Dex is comprised of three parts:
1. The Living Dex - A complete Living Dex filled with all Pokemon and alternate forms
2. The Chronicle Dex - A series of collections of Pokemon important to the games in various ways
3. The Stars Dex - A collection of Pokemon from each generation that are eventful or difficult to come by

This project is inspired by the Master Dex Challenge created by BirdKeeperToby.
