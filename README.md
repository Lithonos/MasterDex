The Master Dex Project

This is the Master Dex Project - a comprehensive collection of all things Pokémon throughout the series. The Master Dex is comprised of three parts:
1. The Living Dex - A collection of all Pokémon species and their various forms that currently exist
2. The Chronicle Dex - A collection of gimmicks, special symbols, and spotlight Pokémon throughout the series
3. The Souvenir Dex - A collection of important, eventful, or difficult to come by Pokémon from each generation

This project is inspired by the Master Dex Challenge created by BirdKeeperToby.
